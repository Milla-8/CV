A CV that is divided into two columns and several sections with contact info, picture, work experience etc.
The CV can be shown on all different screens since it changes the layout of the objects based on screen size.
I used a purple color scheme to match the header and the left column to make it look more personal, but also rememberable for the person who reads it.
All text can be updated to the relevant information and the same with the picture.
I used HTML and CSS to develop the CV.
